Assessment title: Report on a computer network relating to a case study
assessdesc: 
Students should write a report that relates to the requirements of the Acme case study in relation to the design of their new network (please see separate document for the description of the case study and the list of requirements). In your report you should analyse the requirements of the case study by investigating any issues that are likely to impact upon decisions made when designing the new system. You should also discuss any aspects of the requirements that are incomplete or inconsistent and if necessary add to them, justifying any assumptions made.  You should then investigate and analyse solutions that match the requirements, considering alternatives where necessary, and justifying decisions made. All discussion should relate to the context of the case study. You should support your analysis of requirements and the investigation of solutions by appropriate high quality references.
